Right number is a dialing utility for Android.

When you dial a number (be it from your contacts or typed-in), it will intercept the number, detect what format the number is in, and if necessary change the number for the proper format for where you're dialing from.

As an example, in Brazil the +(country code) prefix doesn't work - so dialing +55 31 1234-5678 doesn't work. With right number, however, you can still store all your phone numbers in that format, and have it change it to, for instance, "041 31 1234-5678" if you're dialing from Brazil, or keep the +55 prefix if you're traveling abroad.

This app uses Google's excellent [libphonenumber](http://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/) library.
